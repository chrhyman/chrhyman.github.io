  						<h3>Why do linguists care about this bird?</h3>
							<p>One of the questions that deeply interests linguists is that of how children acquire Language. The idea of an infant getting such a small amount of input but developing a system of communication that is robust and adaptable is nothing short of astounding. As linguistics is a science like any other, one must attempt to follow the experimental method to provide empirical proof of theories about language development.</p>

							<p>The “<b>Wug Test</b>” was developed by <span class="tooltip">Dr. Jean Berko Gleason in 1958
								<span class="tiptext">Berko, J. (1958). The child’s learning of English morphology. <i>WORD, 14</i>(2-3), 150-177. <a href=“http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00437956.1958.11659661”>DOI.</a></span>
							</span> as a psycholinguistic test of a child’s learning of English <span class="tooltip">morphemes
								<span class="tiptext">A <b>morpheme</b> is the smallest unit of meaning in a language, such as "dog" or the "s" that shows plurality in English.</span>
							</span>. The idea, in a nutshell, is to present a child with a brand new word and see if they can successfully modify it to follow English’s rules of <span class="tooltip">allomorphy
								<span class="tiptext"><b>Allomorphs</b> are how one morpheme can be pronounced multiple ways depending on context.</span>
							</span> and pronunciation.</p>

  								<h3>How does it work?</h3>
  								<p>A child is presented with an image like the one to the right. The child must fill in the blank with the word they believe fits hello there now we have even more text. An adult, native English speaker would say "wugs" (rhymes with "mugs"). A child may say "two wug", "two wucks", "two wug-iz", or "two wugses", among other incorrect pluralizations. This often depends on the age of the child, and with a lot of testing we can see how children develop over time.</p>
									<p>This testing format can also be used to test real words. Irregular morphemes are a great test for kids because they show a very interesting linguistic pattern. For example, "one foot, two ____" will usually produce a pattern among kids where younger ones will say "two feet", slightly older kids will say "two foots", and then later on they'll say "two feet" again. The various stages show that children tend to memorize irregular forms, then overgeneralize a pluralization rule, and then lastly learn individual exceptions to that general rule.</p>

									<h3>Academic importance</h3>
									<p align="justify">The discussions raised by this paper greatly influenced psycholinguistics and other fields relating to language acquisition. Furthermore, it provided an easily-explained and accessible example of how linguistic research can be done. Thus, wugs have become one of the most identifiable symbols of the field of linguistics, even for subfields not directly related to phonology and morphology. On top of it all, the paper which discusses the test is extremely accessible and readable, and I encourage everyone who finds this interesting to take at least a cursory look!</p>

									<h3>Personal significance</h3>
									<p align="justify">While I do have a BA in Linguistics with focuses outside of phonology, back in high school I did do a nine-month-long research project which emulated the setup of Dr. Gleason's original test. I went to a local elementary school and tested Kindergarten, 2nd grade, and 4th grade students on various morphological changes to real and made-up words. I also threw in a few non-standard English affixes like "what do you call a small wug?" which caused adults to disagree (wuglett, wuggie, etc.). Seeing adult disagreements where kids tended to agree was even more interesting, as it showed greater learned variety of possible morphological changes to make to made-up words. After nine months of gathering, organizing, and analyzing the data, I like to think I earned my wug cred.</p>
